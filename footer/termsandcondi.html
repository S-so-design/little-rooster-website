  <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms &amp; Conditions apply to all persons who visit any of the Sites 
    (“Visitors”) or transact any business with Little Rooster stores, regardless 
    of a Visitor’s purpose, use, or amount of use. In these Terms, “you” and 
    “your” refer to each Visitor and their agents (unless the context requires 
    otherwise), and “we”, “us”, and “our” refer collectively to Little Rooster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessing or shopping in Little Rooster stores, or accessing the Sites in any 
    manner—whether automated or otherwise—constitutes your use of the Sites and 
    Stores and your agreement to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions, our 
    Privacy Policy, and any additional terms and conditions referenced herein or 
    that may apply to specific sections of the Sites or to products and services 
    made available to you (all of which are deemed part of these Terms &amp; 
    Conditions). These Terms &amp; Conditions supplement any additional terms 
    that may apply to purchases made in-store at a physical retail location.
  </p>

  <p>
    We reserve the right to change these Terms &amp; Conditions or to impose new 
    terms on the use of the Sites and Stores at any time. If changes occur, we 
    will post the revised Terms &amp; Conditions on this website and update the 
    “Last Updated” date accordingly. By continuing to use the Sites after any 
    such changes are posted or after you are notified of material changes, you 
    accept the Terms &amp; Conditions as modified.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also reserve the right to deny access to the Sites or our Stores to anyone 
    who violates or does not consent to these Terms &amp; Conditions or who, in 
    our sole judgment, interferes with the ability of others to enjoy our Sites 
    or Stores or infringes upon the rights of others.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong> THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN 
    AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION, WHICH MEANS YOU AGREE TO 
    RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SITES OR STORES THROUGH 
    BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. THE DISPUTES/ARBITRATION 
    PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS YOU AGREE TO 
    PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION. THIS 
    AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A JURY WAIVER. YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING OR 
    USING ANY OF THE SITES OR STORES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS IN THEIR 
    ENTIRETY.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sites are intended for use and viewing only within the United States. If 
    you do not meet the requirements for use or do not agree to these Terms, you 
    are not authorized to access or view any of the Sites.
